How to upload a snapshot
========================

The following steps explain how you upload a snapshot from your PC to the Pickit system.

- Open the Pickit :ref:`web-interface` and go to **Files**.
- Open the **snapshots** folder and press :guilabel:`Upload` at the top-right.
- Select the ``.snapshot`` files you want to upload and press :guilabel:`Open`.
- Once the files are uploaded, you will find them in the **uploads** folder.
- You can open the uploaded snapshot by simply clicking on it.

.. note:: The above steps are the only way to upload snapshots to the Pickit system. 
   Connecting a USB drive directly to the Pickit processor will not work.
