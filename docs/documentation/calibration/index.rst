Robot camera calibration
------------------------

Robot camera calibration is the process where the camera and the robot learn their relative position
with respect to each other. If done correctly, the camera can guide the robot to correct positions in
the physical environment. Calibration can be performed once the camera and robot have been mounted in
the work cell. This process only needs to be repeated if the camera is moved relative to the robot base,
or vice-versa.

.. warning::
  Wrong or old calibration parameters can lead to unexpected motions. Safe motions of the robot
  must always be checked by the operator of the robot itself and can never be guaranteed by Pickit.

There are two possible ways to perform robot camera calibration: the multi poses and the single pose
method. Both options are briefly described below.

Multi poses calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multi poses method consists of having the robot showing the calibration plate to Pickit five
times. This option is recommended, as it imposes no restrictions on the camera mount, or on how
the calibration plate is fixed to the robot flange.

.. note::
  Go to the :ref:`multi-poses-calibration` article for a step-by-step tutorial.

Single pose calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, the single pose method requires having the robot showing the plate to the
camera only once. However, this option can only be executed if the following restrictions are met:

#. The Pickit camera must be fixed at a stationary location, and cannot be mounted on the robot flange.
#. The robot must have a supported type of flange:
       - ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6 (50 mm width)
       - ISO 9409-1-31.5-4-M5 (31 mm width)
#. The calibration plate must be mounted on the robot flange exactly as described in
   :ref:`installing-calibration-plate`.

.. note::
  Go to the :ref:`single-pose-calibration` article for detailed instructions.

.. warning::
  If after calibration the Pickit camera has been relocated or rotated relatively to the robot base,
  a new robot camera calibration is required before picking, even if the motion was small.

.. important::
  After finishing robot camera calibration, don't forget to check the calibration result. Go to
  :ref:`checking-robot-camera-calibration` to know how.
