Single pose calibration
=======================

Single pose calibration can only be performed if the camera is fixed at a static location, and not
if it's mounted on the robot flange. Furthermore, the robot needs to have either a **50 mm
(ISO 9409-1-50-4-M6)** or **31 mm (ISO 9409-1-31.5-4-M5)** wide flange.

If any of the above requirements are not met, you should use :ref:`multi-poses-calibration` instead.

This article describes the main steps in the single pose calibration procedure:

Mounting the calibration plate
-------------------------------

The advantage of only one pose required for robot camera calibration comes at the cost of Pickit
needing to know how the calibration plate is mounted with respect to the robot flange. Therefore,
the plate should be mounted to the flange in a specific way. :ref:`installing-calibration-plate`
describes the correct way to mount the plate to the flange.

Determining the helper transformation
-------------------------------------

In the Pickit web interface, you need to specify the helper transformation, which is the transformation
between the flange frame of the robot and the calibration plate frame. The figure below shows the
defined calibration plate frame.

If the screw holes of plate and flange are aligned, this transformation consists of:

- a translation along the Z-axis,
- a rotation around the Z-axis.

If the calibration plate is screwed directly to the flange, and oriented according to
:ref:`installing-calibration-plate`, the helper transformations in the table below apply, for the
following robot brands:

+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Robot brand      | Translation in Z | Rotation around Z |
+==================+==================+===================+
| Universal robots | 0 mm             | 45 °              |
+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Fanuc            | 0 mm             | 135 °             |
+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| KUKA             | 0 mm             | -45 °             |
+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Stäubli          | 0 mm             | 135 °             |
+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| ABB              | 0 mm             | -45 °             |
+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| Yaskawa          | 0 mm             | -45 °             |
+------------------+------------------+-------------------+

If the calibration plate is attached to the robot flange through a tool changer or a tool, then
the translation along Z is the distance between the plate and the robot flange.

Building the robot program
--------------------------

In the robot program, the robot should first move to a waypoint where the mounted calibration plate
is shown to the Pickit camera approximately in the center of the 2D image, and close to the picking
area. Make sure the plate is visible in the 2D viewer. Afterwards the program should request Pickit
to find the calibration plate.

Calibrating
-----------

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Calibration` button, located on top of the Pickit web interface.
#. Choose the **fixed** camera mount, since single pose calibration does not support the **robot
   mounted** option.
#. Select the correct robot type: **6 DOF** or **4 DOF**, depending on the number of
   degrees-of-freedom of your robot. If your robot has only 4 degrees-of-freedom, fill
   in the distance between calibration plate and robot flange in the field **Flange Z-axis**.
#. Choose the **single pose** robot camera calibration method.
#. Go through the instructed steps, and run the robot program. You can see the status of the
   calibration process in the Pickit web interface.

  After finishing robot camera calibration, don't forget to check the calibration result. Go to
  :ref:`checking-robot-camera-calibration` to know how.
