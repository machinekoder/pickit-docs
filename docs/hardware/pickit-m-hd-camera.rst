What is Pickit M-HD?
---------------------

Pickit M-HD is a 3D camera that is compatible with the 2.0 version of the
:ref:`hardware/pickit-processor:Pickit processor`.
It's called M-HD because it is a high definition camera with a field of
view to detect medium-sized objects. The 3D camera is manufactured
by `Zivid AS <https://zividlabs.com/>`__ in Norway. The camera
produces a high-resolution point cloud to detect and pick smaller
objects with higher accuracy compared to the existing Pickit M camera.
